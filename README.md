# Leetcode grind

Leetcode problems are the secret handshake for big tech companies. They might be a big waste of time for real-world problems, but it is what it is.

This repository is a collection of my solutions to Leetcode problems. Feel free to use it as a reference. Happy coding!
 
# Study plan

## 1. Arrays and Strings
Start with problems focused on basic array and string manipulations.

### Two Pointers
Use two indices to iterate from both ends towards the center.
- [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum)
- [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water)
- [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum)

### Sliding Window
Maintain a subset of elements within the array/string and move this window to achieve optimal solutions.
- [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)
- [Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum)
- [Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string)

## 2. Linked Lists
Problems focusing on manipulating linked list nodes.

### Basic Operations
Reverse, merge, and manipulate nodes.
- [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list)
- [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists)
- [Remove N-th Node from End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list)

## 3. Trees
Explore tree traversal and manipulation techniques.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
Explore tree branches deeply before backtracking.
- [Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal)
- [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree)
- [Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree)

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Traverse tree levels one by one.
- [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal)
- [Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node)
- [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands)

## 4. Graphs
Focus on graph traversal and shortest path algorithms.

### DFS and BFS
Traverse graphs using stacks and queues.
- [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph)
- [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule)
- [Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder)

## 5. Dynamic Programming (DP)
Solve complex problems by breaking them into simpler sub-problems.

### Classic DP Problems
- [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs)
- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock)
- [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence)
- [Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change)

## 6. Recursion and Backtracking
Problems that can be solved by breaking them down recursively.

### Backtracking
Try all possible solutions and backtrack when a solution fails.
- [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations)
- [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets)
- [Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum)
